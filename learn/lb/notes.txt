Read about weigted round robin (weird algorithm : smooth weighted rr)
This algorithm's feel:
    Each server builds up “credit” via CurrentWeight += Weight.
    Servers are picked when their CurrentWeight rises highest.
    After being selected, they “pay” for the request with CurrentWeight -= totalWeight.
    Over time, this balances out and ensures proportional selection.
